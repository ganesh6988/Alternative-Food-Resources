        <h2>Insects have been a food staple in some countries for centuries,</br> but they are now beginning to disrupt Western agricultural and</br> aquaculturewith their high feed efficiencies and attractive</br> environmental credentials With increasing demand for </br>high-protein food and new products appearing regularly,</br> this is a breakthrough market to watch.</h2>
</br>
<h4>The world population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, which will</br>
    require a doubling of food production. Rising incomes and urbanisation in</br>
    developing countries are creating increased protein demand, with dangerous</br> consequences for resource usage. The US food production system is estimated</br> to use 80% of the countryâ€™s freshwater, 50% of the total land area, and 17% of </br>the fossil energy. Additionally, the global agriculture system is estimated to be </br>responsible for around 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. There</br> is a clear need to ensure that we feed the growing population in a sustainable</br> way, while also ensuring food security for all.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
Entomophagy, or the eating of insects, is one way to supplement protein in a</br> diet, with reduced resource and energy intensity per land area. Insects also have</br> a higher feed conversion efficiency, lower risk of passing an infection on to </br>people, and impressive nutritional stats compared with traditional animal </br>agriculture. As well as directly reducing demand for traditional livestock,</br> insects also have a role to play in making other types of agriculture more </br>sustainable. For example, replacing soya as a cattle feed can reduce</br> deforestation and associated biodiversity loss by requiring less land per kilo of </br>feed. Insects are also a more sustainable aquaculture feed compared with </br>traditional fish or animal-based feeds.</br>
